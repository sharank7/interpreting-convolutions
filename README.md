# Interpreting Convolutions

## Overview
An AI Club Deputy Coordinator Mini-Project for the tenure 2025-26 aimed at interpreting Convolutional Neural Networks, through methods that involve inspecting their internal mechanisms. 

## Objectives
- Build intuition for how Deep Convolutional Neural Networks process and represent visual information in image classification tasks  
- Design and conduct controlled experiments to understand the internal mechanisms of CNNs, including convolutional operators, feature maps, and learned representations  
- Analyze how adversarial attacks arise from internal network representations  
- Create activation atlases and other visualizations to understand representations
